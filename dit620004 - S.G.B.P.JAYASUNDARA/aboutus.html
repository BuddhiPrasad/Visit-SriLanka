                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>We are delighted to introduce you to the incredible destination of Sri Lanka. 
                    For more than two decades we have been planning and arranging holidays for 
                    travellers to south Asia, with a particular focus on Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Unbound) 
                    and India (India Unbound), as well as personally leading small group tours. We have 
                    created custom made journeys that cover the length and breadth of Sri Lanka and 
                    India – journeys that range from cultural sightseeing, wildlife tours, wellness 
                    retreats to tracing family histories and everything in between.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have planned trips for groups of friends, for families of multiple generations 
                    holidaying together, for special events and celebrations in remarkable locations, 
                    for solo travellers and couples. We plan trips for all budgets and all lengths. Our 
                    expertise in these destinations is backed by our own frequent travel. Our staff spend 
                    many months each year visiting each destination, appraising hotels and activities, 
                    making sure we have the best local guides, and staying up-to-date with locations – 
                    from knowing about new restaurants and boutiques, to changes at hotels and sights.
